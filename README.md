# RxServer

This is the repository for the [RxDB Server plugins](https://rxdb.info/rx-server.html).

The code of the server plugins is in a different repository because:
- It has too many dependencies that you do not want to install if you only use RxDB at the client side.
- It has a different license [(SSPL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Side_Public_License) to prevent large cloud vendors from "stealing" the revenue. [Similar to MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/legal/licensing/server-side-public-license/faq)


## Issues
The issue section of this repository is closed. Please make issues directly at the [RxDB Repo](https://github.com/pubkey/rxdb/issues).
