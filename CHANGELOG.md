### Bug Fixes

- Fix REST `/delete` endpoint returning 403 Forbidden when `serverOnlyFields` is configured. The delete handler passed full documents (including server-only fields) to the `changeValidator`, which always rejected them because the wrapper checks for the presence of server-only fields. Now the server-only fields are stripped before validation, consistent with the `/set` endpoint behavior.
